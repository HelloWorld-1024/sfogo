# Spring Cloud Demo
This is a simple (not [secured](http://projects.spring.io/spring-security), not [containerized](https://docs.docker.com/engine/understanding-docker/)) demo whose objective is to showcase a possible (if not typical) microservices [Spring Cloud](http://projects.spring.io/spring-cloud) landscape where
- Participants (i.e Services) pull their configuration from a central location (Configuration Server)
- Participants self-register with a registry service
- A gateway publicly exposes some of the services
- Services exist in multiple instances
